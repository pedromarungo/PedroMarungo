# Hello World ... Access Granted.

I’ve been learning ethical hacking for a while now, mostly through TryHackMe where I’ve kept a yearly premium account. I spend most of my time working through labs, practicing techniques, and exploring red team and penetration testing concepts. I don’t really share much on GitHub yet since most of what I do is practice or temporary projects, but eventually I’d like to put together something more permanent.

I’m not looking for work at the moment. Maybe later I’ll consider remote roles in security, penetration testing, or red teaming.

🤝 Open to small collaborations like CTFs or research, nothing too big
⚡ I tend to collect security books and resources. Half the time it’s for study, the other half is just curiosity.
