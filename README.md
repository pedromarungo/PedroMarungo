# Hello World — Builder Mode

I'm focused on building practical web and mobile apps with React, Next.js, Express, and React Native. I enjoy creating interfaces, shipping features, and connecting frontends to reliable backends. I’m gradually moving my practice projects onto GitHub as I turn brief experiments into reusable projects and demos.

🧠 Current focus: React, Next.js, Express, React Native (cross-platform apps + APIs)

🤝 Open to small collaborations — app prototypes, UI work, or mobile experiments

⚡ I like collecting useful libraries, starter templates, and patterns to speed up build time

Not currently looking for work — mostly building, learning, and shipping small projects.
